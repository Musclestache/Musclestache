- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthew Baltzer!
- 👀 I’m an apsiring Software Engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript/typescript for web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects to broaden my understanding.
- 📫 You can reach me at baltzer.matt@gmail.com
- 💻 I've always been fascinated by coding and have wanted to pursue a career in it since College so I'm finally making that dream a reality.
- 👷 I come from a construction background so I'm no stranger to hardwork. After my back injury, I realized it was time to shift gears and make the changes I wanted in my life, so here we are.
